I created a complete QA project to test the flight booking site 
. I set up a Jira Scrum project and organized all testing work inside Zephyr Scale, where I created a dedicated folder for the application. I wrote about 40 detailed test cases covering login, selecting flights, booking details, and negative scenarios such as invalid dates and missing passenger information. During execution I discovered and reported a critical bug that allowed a return date earlier than the departure date. I then built and ran a test cycle, tracked the pass/fail status of all cases, and finally generated detailed reports summarizing the cycle results and the discovered bug. This project demonstrates my ability to plan, document, and deliver a professional end-to-end testing process using Jira and Zephyr Scale.
